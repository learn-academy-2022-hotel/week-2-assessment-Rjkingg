# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument? 

Your answer: The way that I like to remember the difference beween parameters and arguments is that the P, in parameters- placeholder and parethesis. The argument is what goes inside of the parameter to define 
Researched answer:
The values that are declared within a function when the function is called, is an argument. Function parameters are names listed in the functions definition. A parameter is one of the variables in a function.
2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: 
In JavaScript, .map() method has been used in functions to get an array from a function. Off of the top, I was not too sure about the optional parameters.
Researched answer:
They are: value (required) index, array (optional)
3. What is the difference between map and filter?
Your answer:
 The difference between the two is that map utilizes all of the elements in an array while filter creates a new array with all of the elements had a value of true
Researched answer:
.map returns a new array of elements and typically changes the new element where you've applied some function on the element. .filter returns a new array of the elements of the original array.
4. What is iteration?
Your answer:
I got string interpolation confused with iteration until my breakout room partner corrected me.
Researched answer:
Iterable objects are objects that can be iterated over with for...Of.
5. What is the difference between a class and an object?
Your answer:
An object is a non-primitive data type and consists of key value pairs. 
Researched answer: 
A Class defines an object and object behavior while an object is a member or an "instance" of class
6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer:
Was not too sure about this one. My guess would be code being moved up. How I understand hoisting something is to pull it up.
Researched answer:
Hoisting is the proccess whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of code.
